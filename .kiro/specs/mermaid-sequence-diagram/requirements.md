****# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds the capability to generate Mermaid sequence diagrams from goat state machine specifications. The sequence diagrams will visualize the communication patterns defined in the state machine specifications themselves, independent of the model checking execution. This will help developers understand and document the intended interaction patterns between different state machines based on their event handlers and SendTo() calls.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using goat, I want to generate Mermaid sequence diagrams from my state machine specifications, so that I can visualize the communication patterns defined in my event handlers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user calls a sequence diagram generation function with state machine specifications THEN the system SHALL analyze the event handlers to extract communication patterns
2. WHEN event handlers contain SendTo() calls THEN the system SHALL identify these as message flows between participants
3. WHEN the diagram is generated THEN the system SHALL output valid Mermaid sequence diagram syntax
4. WHEN multiple state machines are provided THEN the system SHALL represent each as a separate participant in the sequence diagram

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the sequence diagram to show the potential message flows based on event handlers, so that I can understand the designed communication patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an event handler contains SendTo() calls THEN the system SHALL represent these as arrows from the handler's state machine to the target
2. WHEN events trigger state transitions THEN the system SHALL show the event name as the message label
3. WHEN analyzing OnEntry, OnEvent, and OnExit handlers THEN the system SHALL extract all potential SendTo() communications

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate sequence diagrams that show the logical flow of events, so that I can document the intended system behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OnEntry handlers send events THEN the system SHALL show these as initial messages in the sequence
2. WHEN OnEvent handlers respond with SendTo() calls THEN the system SHALL show the request-response pattern
3. WHEN multiple event handlers exist for the same state THEN the system SHALL represent all possible communication paths

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the generated sequence diagrams to be easily readable and properly formatted, so that I can use them for documentation and communication purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN participant names are generated THEN the system SHALL use clear, readable names based on state machine types
2. WHEN event names are displayed THEN the system SHALL use the actual event type names from the Go code
3. WHEN the diagram is output THEN the system SHALL include proper Mermaid sequence diagram headers and formatting
4. WHEN multiple instances of the same state machine type exist THEN the system SHALL distinguish them with unique participant names
